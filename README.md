# Ricardo Alatorre | Data Scientist | Chicago Booth MBA

## About Me

My name is Ricardo Alatorre, and I am a native of Monterrey, Nuevo León, México, where I've lived most of my life. I've also spent portions of my life in the United States, first as a college student in New York City, then as a business school student and senior program manager in Chicago. A committed student of mathematics, I've taken steps to develop my skills in quantitative modeling throughout the course of my career and have recently decided to pivot into data science, completing General Assembly's Data Science Immersive program in February 2023. After taking a few months off, I pivoted to working freelance as an analytics consultant.
