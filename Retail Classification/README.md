# Customer Segmentation Project

In this project, we take a look at marketing campaign data for a grocer and try to understand its customer base for the purposes of improving our marketing campaigns in the future.
By leveraging unsupervised learning methods such as k-means clustering and Principal Components Analysis as a means of dimensionality reduction, we were able to separate the grocer's customer base
into four distinct segments: Working Families, Young Parents, Middle-Income Families, and Childless Professionals, identifying possible avenues to reach each and drive sales.
